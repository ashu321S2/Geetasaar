                <h3 style="text-justify: auto;">
                 The <strong>Bhagavad Gita</strong>, meaning “Song of the Lord,” is one of the most important spiritual classics in world literature. It forms part of the great Indian epic <em>Mahabharata</em>, specifically the Bhishma Parva (Book of Bhishma), and is presented as a dialogue between Lord Krishna and the warrior prince Arjuna. This conversation takes place on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, just before the war is to begin, at a time when Arjuna is gripped with despair and confusion about his role in the conflict.
                <br><br>
                Ved Vyasa is traditionally credited as the author of the Mahabharata, the epic within which the section of Bhagavad Gita, a book in itself appears. According to popular faith, Vyasa dictated the Mahabharata to Lord Ganesha, who wrote it down. Since the Gita is a part of this massive epic, it is commonly believed that Vyasa was the one who recorded Krishna’s words before the battle.<br><br>
                
                “In the timeless words of the Gita, discover strength in truth, peace in duty, and divinity in the self — this is not just scripture, it is a guide to life.” <br>
                  <br>
                  
                
                Traditionally dated to around the 2nd century BCE, though possibly much older in oral tradition, the Bhagavad Gita reflects the synthesis of multiple Indian philosophical schools such as Vedanta, Sankhya, Yoga, and Bhakti. The Gita distills timeless wisdom and places it in the framework of a practical life dilemma — a warrior refusing to fight his own kinsmen. In response, Lord Krishna delivers deep metaphysical teachings on the nature of the soul, karma, duty (dharma), and liberation (moksha).<br>
                
                 <br>
                The Bhagavad Gita is composed of 18 chapters and 700 Sanskrit verses. It is not a separate scripture but an integral part of a larger epic, yet it stands independently due to its philosophical and spiritual richness. Unlike purely devotional texts, the Gita blends action, knowledge, and devotion into a cohesive worldview, advocating for a life of righteous action without attachment to results — the essence of Karma Yoga.<br>
               <br>
                Throughout history, the Bhagavad Gita has been revered by saints, philosophers, and leaders alike. Adi Shankaracharya wrote a renowned commentary on it, grounding it in non-dualist Advaita Vedanta philosophy. Modern thinkers such as Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi, Aurobindo, and even Western philosophers like Aldous Huxley and Carl Jung acknowledged its profound impact.<br>
                <br>
                The message of the Gita remains timeless. It teaches that the path to spiritual freedom lies in realizing one's divine nature and performing one's duty with discipline, detachment, and devotion. It is a scripture not just of religion, but of ethics, purpose, and self-realization. Even today, it continues to illuminate minds across the world, offering solace, clarity, and direction in the journey of life.<br>
